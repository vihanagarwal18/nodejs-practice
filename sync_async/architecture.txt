flow start from client
client make request to the server 
in there is event queue (fifo)
then these request go to event loop (it checks whether there is any request in the event queue)

a request can be of 2 types
1>blocking operations/synchronous task


2> non blocking operations/ asynchronous task

if request is non blocking operation then it will pick it and process it and send the response to the client 

if request is blocking operation then it go to thread pool(where all the threads are there),
threads are as a worker which do your task ,then these threads are assigned to a blocking operations if they are available then when task is finished thread will again go to thread pool and result would be given and it would be send as response
