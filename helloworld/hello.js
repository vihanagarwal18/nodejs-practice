console.log("Hey there! i am js");
//to run this file we need to ride node hello.js or node hello

//we need to use node js to run javascript outside it engine node js in a runtime environment
// console.log(window);
// console.log(alert("hey")); 

//these 2 lines wont run here because we didnt directly integrate it with cpp , we dont have window elements like navigator and all 
//only core functionalities are there of server side

//some features are added also for example cryptographic technique and exception handling


//to create package.json file we will use npm init this is a configuritional file we could make this manually also but it has a risk of erros


// we can create our own scripts in this package.json like type 'npm run customscript'
//now using this we can make different scripts like on start ,on login
